I Tried my best to learn the technologies its been just the project specific but i learned a lot by it , its been very hard to make it even if its done already.
I tried to capture all the knowledge and style as good as possible , its been a hard and great journey  - no matter what happens i will continue my journey to be a developer . 
Thanks to all the teachers and this course , and my best wishes to all. Thankyou.
